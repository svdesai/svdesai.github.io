I'm Vikas Desai, a deep learning researcher with interests in developing limited supervision techniques based on active learning and meta learning for label intensive computer vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. I'm fortunate to have been a part of [Dr. Vineeth N Balasubramanian's
](https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/) research group - [Lab1055](https://lab1055.github.io/) at [IIT Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/), while closely collaborating with [Dr. Wei Guo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pnMyJLEAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Field Phenomics Lab](http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/Field-Phenomics/ninolab/index.html), University of Tokyo. During my time at IITH, my research focused on using active learning techniques for object detection with applications to precision agriculture and plant phenotyping. I have done internships at [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) (Summer 2018) and [AIST Tokyo](https://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html) (Summer 2019). 

I love to keep up with new research by writing paper summaries as blog posts. You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/end_duality_gap) and [github](https://github.com/svdesai). 

I'm currently interested in developing meta learning and RL techniques for label efficient multi task learning. If your interests are similar and you would like to collaborate, feel free to drop a mail!
